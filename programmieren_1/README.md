Programmieren 1 - Exercise Solutions

Hello young Padawans,

This repo was created to accompany you in the adventure of solving the exercises of the "Programmieren 1" course, which is a long and tiring journey. So, this is a haven where you can take shelter when you feel lost in the magical world of codes. 🚢

What Will You Find? 🧐

Here you will find solutions to exercises you may encounter within the scope of the course. But remember, what you see here are not absolute and immutable facts! Writing code is an art, and like every art, it has many different interpretations and techniques. The solutions here are just suggestions, in other words, they are a beacon that will guide you on this long road.

Important note! 📝

This repo is not a "mystery projects library". So, you won't find life-changing or world-saving projects here. I am only sharing the solutions of the exercises within the scope of the course. But who knows, maybe you'll be inspired by these solutions and create something that will truly change the world! 🌍

Did You Find An Error? 🕵️

Every human being makes mistakes, and yes, I am human too (for now!). So if you find any errors in the solutions or would like to suggest a different solution, please feel free to contact me. Together, we can work to make this repo an even better resource. You can use my email address for communication.

Last Words 🎤

This repo was created to help you. I hope your time here will be both educational and enjoyable. Remember, the challenges you face in your programming journey make you stronger. That's why every mistake you make can actually be your greatest teacher.

Have fun, young Jedi! May the code be with you! 🚀
